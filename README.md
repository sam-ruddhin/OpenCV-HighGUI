# OpenCV-HighGUI

So, what exactly is HighGUI?

It’s a high-level graphical interface module in OpenCV that helps you display images and videos, create windows, and handle user input. In short, it gives you the tools to open an image, interact with it, and adjust things in real time, all without needing any other GUI framework.

In this repo, we’ll take a closer look at how you can use OpenCV HighGUI to build interactive and dynamic applications. We’ll go through how to handle mouse and keyboard events, create trackbars and sliders for live parameter tuning, and design custom windows that go beyond the basics.
